Another site, another blog, another post, another bit of electronic dust on electronic wind.

As you can probably tell, this is a personal site, a bit of fluff to pass the time and shout my voice into the void for a while and add mine to the mass of voices that are swallowed up whole by the passage of time. I also want to see what I can do with the damn thing, see what kind of website I can whip together.
